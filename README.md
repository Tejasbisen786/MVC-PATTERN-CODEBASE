# MVC Pattern Code README

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. MVC is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering for developing user interfaces. It separates the concerns of an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

## MVC Overview
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database, performs calculations, and enforces business rules.
- **View**: Presents the user interface of the application. It displays data from the model to the user and sends user inputs to the controller for processing.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the view, processes it using the model, and updates the view accordingly.

## Structure
The codebase is organized into the following directories:

- **models**: Contains classes representing the data model of the application. These classes encapsulate the data and behavior related to specific entities within the system.
- **views**: Contains templates or user interface components responsible for rendering data to the user. Views are typically HTML files with embedded dynamic content.
- **controllers**: Contains classes responsible for handling user input, invoking appropriate actions on the model, and updating the view accordingly.
- **routes**: Defines the routes or URLs of the application and maps them to controller actions. Routes specify which controller action should be invoked when a particular URL is accessed.

## Installation
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Tejasbisen786/MVC-PATTERN-CODEBASE.git
